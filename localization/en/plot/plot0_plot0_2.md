|我们离开这里！看它那雪狗怎么办！|Let's get out of here and see how the snowdogs manage the snowbears!|
|走！|Leave!|
|我们确实该离开。|We really should leave.|
|这，这不对吧？|Wait... leave?|
|北郊有一个荒地，我们或许可以建造属于自己的村子。|There's a wasteland in the northern outskirts where we could build our own village.|
|（或许，再这样待下去，我们也不过是雪狗的工具罢。）|(Maybe they were right. We'll just remain tools for the snowdogs if we don't leave.)|
|我们走！|Let's move!|
