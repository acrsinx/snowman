|雪人们，在我的带领下，我们胜利了！|Snowmen, under my leadship, we've won!|
|就像之前一样，这次的功劳就由我上报。|Just like before, I'll report our victory.|
|可是……|But...|
|“可是”什么“可是”，我说话你们听着就行了。回军营待命！|"But" what? Just listen to me. Back to the base and await orders!|
|每次胜利，都是雪狗请功去了。|Every victory, it's the snowdogs that take the credit.|
|是啊，它们总不把我们当成生物。|Yes, they never regarded us as living beings.|
|雪狗们自以为是，自矜攻伐。|They're so full of themselves.|
|就是！就是！|Absolutely! Absolutely!|
|（或许，成为一个独立自主的雪人要取一个名字。）|(Maybe, to be an independent snowman, I need a name.)|
