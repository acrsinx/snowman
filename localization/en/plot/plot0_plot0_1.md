|雪人们，我们胜利了！|Snowmen, we won!|
|在此等待，我去请功了。|I'll go and claim the victory. Wait for me here.|
|每次胜利，都是雪狗请功去了。|Every time we win, it's the snow dogs that claim the victory.|
|是啊，它们总不把我们当成生物。|Yes, they never regarded us as creatures.|
|雪狗们自以为是，自矜攻伐。|They are arrogant and proud.|
|就是！就是！|Exactly! Exactly!|
|（或许，成为一个独立自主的雪人要取一个名字。）|(Perhaps, becoming an independent snowman requires a name.)|
